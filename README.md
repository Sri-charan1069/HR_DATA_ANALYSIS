# HR Data Analysis Project Using SQL and Power BI Dashboards

This project involves analyzing randomly chosen HR data using SQL and visualizing the results with Power BI dashboards. SQL queries were used to extract and analyze key HR metrics such as employee performance and attrition rates. The insights were then visualized in Power BI to create interactive dashboards, providing a comprehensive view of HR trends and facilitating data-driven decision-making. This project demonstrates the use of SQL and Power BI for effective HR data analysis.
